# chmod command

# Chmod lets you change the permissions of files or directories. The basic syntax looks as follows:

chmod [options] [permission] [file_or_directory]

# In Linux, there are three folder and file permissions – read (r), write (w), and execute (x). You can assign them to three parties – the owner, a group, or other accounts belonging to neither category. Consider this example:

chmod -rwx---r-– file1.txt
