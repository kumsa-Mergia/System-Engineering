# The main usage of the mv command is to move a file or folder to another location. Here’s the syntax:

mv file_or_directory [target_directory]

# For example, we will move file1.txt from another location to the /new/file/directory path using this command:

mv /original/path/file1.txt the/target/path

# You can also use the mv command to rename files in your Linux system. Here’s an example:

mv old_name.txt new_name.txt

# If you specify the full path, you can simultaneously rename files and move them to a new location like this example:

mv old/location/of/old_name.txt new/path/for/new_name.txt
