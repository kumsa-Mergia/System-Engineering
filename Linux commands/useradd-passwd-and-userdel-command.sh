# useradd, passwd, and userdel command

# Use the useradd command to create a new account in your Linux system. The syntax is as follows:

useradd [options] new_username

# By default, the useradd command doesnâ€™t prompt you to give the new user a password. You can add or change it manually later with the passwd command:

passwd new_username

# To remove a user, use the userdel command followed by the account name like the syntax in the example:

userdel new_username
