# Use cd to navigate between directories in your Linux VPS. It doesn’t have any option, and the syntax is simple:

cd [path_or_directory]

# Depending on your location, you might only need to specify the parent directory. For example, omit path from path/to/directory if you are already inside one. The cd command has several shortcuts:

    # cd – returns to the current user’s home directory.
    # cd .. – moves a directory up.
    # cd – – goes back to the previous directory.
