# Use the cp command to copy files from your current directory to another folder. The syntax looks like this:

cp file1 file2 [target_path]

# You can also use cp to duplicate the content of one file to another using this syntax. If the target is in another location, specify the full path like so:

cp source_file /path/to/target_file

# Additionally, cp lets you duplicate a directory and its content to another folder using the -R option:

cp -R /path/to/folder /target/path/to/folder_copy
