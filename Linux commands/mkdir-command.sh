# The mkdir command lets you create one or multiple directories. The syntax looks like this:

mkdir [options] directory_name1 directory_name2

# To create a folder in another location, specify the full path. Otherwise, this command will make the new item in your current working directory.

# For example, enter the following to create new_folder in /path/to/target_folder:

mkdir path/to/target_folder/new_folder

# By default, mkdir allows the current user to read, write, and execute files in the new folder. You can set custom privileges during the creation by adding the -m option. To learn more about permission management, read the chmod section below.
