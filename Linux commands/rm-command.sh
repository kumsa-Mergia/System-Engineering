# The rm command deletes files from a directory. You must have the write permission for the folder or use sudo. Hereâ€™s the syntax:

rm [options] file1 file2

# You can add the -r option to remove a folder and its contents, including subdirectories. Use the -i flag to display a confirmation message before the removal or -f to deactivate it completely.

# NOTE: Warning! Avoid using -r and -f unless necessary. Instead, add -i option to prevent accidental deletion.
