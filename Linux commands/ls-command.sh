// The ls command lists the content of a folder, including files and directories. Hereâ€™s the syntax:

ls [options] [directory_or_path]

// If you omit the path, the ls command will check the content of your current directory. To list items inside subfolders, add the -R option. Meanwhile, use -a to show hidden content.
