cut options file

# Unlike other Linux utilities, the cut command’s options are mandatory for file sectioning. Here are some of the flags:

  #  -f – selects a specific row field.
  #     -b – cuts the line by a specified byte size.
  #     -c – sections the line using a specified character.
  #     -d – separates lines based on delimiters.
