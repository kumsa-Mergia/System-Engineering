# Use the head command to print the first few entries of a file. The basic syntax is as follows:

head [options] file_name

# You can also print the first few lines of another commandâ€™s output by piping it like so:

command | head [options]

# By default, head will show the first ten lines. However, you can change this setting using the -n option followed by your desired number.
