# su and whoami commands

# The su command lets you switch to another user in the Terminal session. The syntax looks as follows:

su [options] [username]

# If you donâ€™t specify any option or username, this command will switch you to the root user. In this case, you must enter the password before changing the account.

# You can check the currently logged-in user from the Linux command-line shell. Alternatively, use the whoami command:

whoami
