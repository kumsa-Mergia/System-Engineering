# Use the sed command to search and replace patterns in files quickly. The basic syntax looks like this:

sed [options] 'subcommand/new_pattern/target_pattern' input_file

# You can replace a string in multiple files simultaneously by listing them. Hereâ€™s an example of a sed command that changes red in colors.txt and hue.txt with blue:

sed 's/red/blue' colors.txt hue.txt
