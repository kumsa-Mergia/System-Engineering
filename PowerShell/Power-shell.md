# PowerShell

PowerShell is a powerful scripting language and command-line shell developed by Microsoft for automating tasks and managing configurations. It combines the functionality of the traditional command prompt with a more advanced scripting language that can interact with the .NET framework, providing users with more control and flexibility over their Windows environment.

Here are some key features of PowerShell:

    1. Cmdlets: 
	* Built-in commands designed to perform specific tasks (e.g., Get-Process, Set-Item).
    2. Pipelines: 
	* Allows you to pass the output of one cmdlet as input to another (e.g., Get-Process | Stop-Process).
    3. Scripting: 
	* You can write complex scripts that automate administrative tasks.
    4. Remote Management:
	* Enables remote execution of commands on other systems via PowerShell Remoting.
    5. Object-Oriented: 
	* Everything in PowerShell is an object, which makes it easier to manage and manipulate data.
    6. Cross-Platform: 
	* PowerShell Core (v6+) works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
